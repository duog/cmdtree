cmdtree
======= 

cmdtree is a command launcher in the form of a trie. Commands are launched by a
sequence of keys that form a path in this trie.

Configuring cmdtree is easy (this format is still WIP):

~/.cmdtreerc or ~/.config/cmdtree/cmdtreerc:

(a application
   (b chrome --force-device-scale-factor=1.25)
   (e emacs)
)
